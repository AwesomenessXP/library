# Library App
- Link to the [library app](https://awesomenessxp.github.io/library/).
# Challenges:
## Making the pop-up screen
- Fix:
- set z-index and visiblity to zero
- dynamically change z-index using JS
## Submit button would clear data when clicking
- Fix (kind of):
- left `action` and `post` empty in form element
## Submit button would not validate data when clicked
- Fix:
- manually added validation in JS to only submit data if
    the text fields are not empty
# Features I want to add:
- style the page and add interactive button functionality
